The provided XML file is a deadlock report from SQL Server. A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are each waiting for the other to release a resource, resulting in a standoff where none of the processes can proceed. Here is an analysis of the deadlock scenario from your XML file:
1. **Victim Process**:
   - **ID**: `process1fbb06ad088`
   - The system has chosen this process as the victim to resolve the deadlock.

2. **Process List**:
   - **Process 1**:
     - **ID**: `process1fbb06ad088`
     - **Wait Resource**: `KEY: 10:72057594044809216`
     - **Lock Mode**: `S` (Shared)
     - **Current SQL**:
       ```sql
       SELECT orderid, productid, unitprice
       FROM Sales.OrderDetails 
       WHERE productid = 2;
       COMMIT TRAN;
       ```
   - **Process 2**:
     - **ID**: `process1fbb06ad848`
     - **Wait Resource**: `KEY: 10:72057594043695104`
     - **Lock Mode**: `S` (Shared)
     - **Current SQL**:
       ```sql
       SELECT productid, unitprice
       FROM Production.Products 
       WHERE productid = 2;
       COMMIT TRAN;
       ```
3. **Resource List**:
   - **Resource 1**:
     - **Object Name**: `TSQL2012.Sales.OrderDetails`
     - **Index Name**: `PK_OrderDetails`
     - **Lock Mode**: `X` (Exclusive)
     - **Owner**: `process1fbb06ad848`
     - **Waiter**: `process1fbb06ad088`
   

   - **Resource 2**:
     - **Object Name**: `TSQL2012.Production.Products`
     - **Index Name**: `PK_Products`
     - **Lock Mode**: `X` (Exclusive)
     - **Owner**: `process1fbb06ad088`
     - **Waiter**: `process1fbb06ad848`

### Summary of the Deadlock
- **Process 1 (ID: `process1fbb06ad088`)** is holding an exclusive lock (`X`) on `TSQL2012.Production.Products` and is waiting for a shared lock (`S`) on `TSQL2012.Sales.OrderDetails`.
- **Process 2 (ID: `process1fbb06ad848`)** is holding an exclusive lock (`X`) on `TSQL2012.Sales.OrderDetails` and is waiting for a shared lock (`S`) on `TSQL2012.Production.Products`.
- This results in a circular wait, causing the deadlock.

### Solution
To resolve deadlocks, consider the following strategies:
1. **Query Optimization**: Ensure that queries access resources in the same order whenever possible.
2. **Deadlock Priority**: Set deadlock priority for less critical transactions to be the preferred victim.
3. **Locking Hints**: Use locking hints (e.g., `NOLOCK`, `UPDLOCK`) judiciously to minimize lock contention.
4. **Transaction Scope**: Keep transactions as short as possible to reduce the chance of deadlocks.
